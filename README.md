# conan-GSL
Conan (https://conan.io) package for Microsoft C++ Core Guidelines Support Library, or GSL (https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL)

# Version Number Schema

The GSL does not offer any version numbers, so for now I've set this to
"0.0.0.0-1". The dash-1 represents the incrementing versions of this
Conan package itself, which may (possibly, theoretically) be updated with
different versions of the Git repo, assuming I ever push to stable.

# Credit

Nearly all of this was stolen from Memsharded's spdlog Conan file, but please
note that all mistakes and imperfections from the duplication are copyrighted
by me.


I have no relation to the Microsoft GSL library authors.
